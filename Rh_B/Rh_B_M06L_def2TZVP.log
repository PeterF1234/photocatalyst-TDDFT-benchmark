 THE VALUE OF PHILOSOPHY IS, IN FACT, TO BE SOUGHT LARGELY IN ITS
 VERY UNCERTAINTY.  THE MAN WHO HAS NO TINCTURE OF PHILOSOPHY GOES
 THROUGH LIFE IMPRISONED IN THE PREJUDICES DERIVED FROM COMMON SENSE,
 FROM THE HABITUAL BELIEFS OF HIS AGE OR HIS NATION, AND FROM
 CONVICTIONS WHICH HAVE GROWN UP IN HIS MIND WITHOUT THE CO-OPERATION
 OR CONSENT OF HIS DELIBERATE REASON.  TO SUCH A MAN THE WORLD TENDS
 TO BE DEFINITE, FINITE, OBVIOUS; COMMON OBJECTS ROUSE NO QUESTIONS,
 AND UNFAMILIAR POSSIBILITIES ARE CONTEMPTUOUSLY REJECTED.
